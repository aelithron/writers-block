## Using
Using Writer's Block is simple! Just go to [wb.axionspire.net](https://wb.axionspire.net) and sign in with Google (or if you're in Hack Club, you can use Slack).
### Selfhosting
Selfhosting the app is a bit more complex, but can be done! I suggest using Docker, though I am sadly unable to provide a prebuilt image for now.
1. Environment Variables
Set up the following environment variables:
- `MONGODB_URI`: A MongoDB connection string to your database server.
- `MONGODB_DB`: The name of your database. Make sure it contains a collection called `stories`!
- `AUTH_SECRET`: A random string to secure user sessions. You can generate this with the command `openssl rand -base64 33` on Linux.
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`: A Google Cloud OAuth ID and Secret. This will enable Google login. You can configure this [on Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview), make sure to create a project and follow their setup. Your redirect URI is `https://[domain].[tld]/api/auth/callback/google`.
- `AUTH_SLACK_ID` and `AUTH_SLACK_SECRET`: Optional, a Slack OAuth ID and Secret. Just like above, this enables Slack login. You can create a Slack app and add it's ID and secret here. No links are provided, as it's a complicated process to set up. Your redirect URL is `https://[domain].[tld]/api/auth/callback/slack`.
2. Build a Docker image for the app. To make sure the build goes smoothly, add a file in the source code directory called `.env.local` with the text `MONGODB_URI=[your connection string]`. Then, I suggest running `docker build -t writers-block:v1.0.0 .` from the same directory.
3. Run the image with either a `docker run` command or Docker Compose. If you're so inclined, you can use Kubernetes also. Make sure to include the environment variables!

## Extra Notes
The name "Writer's Block" is both based on the idea this app could help you get over actual writer's block, as well as that it's got most/all the tools a writer needs (as in, kinda like the equivalent to a corner store on an irl city block).
